Rabbi\n>Zimmerman was the seventh president of the college, which was\n>founded in 1875.\n>\n> Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff, the conference's executive vice president,\n>said its board approved the penalty on Monday, based on a\n>recommendation by its ethics committee, which looks into complaints\n>about the conference's 1,700 members.\n>\n> Rabbi Menitoff said that conference rules prevented him from\n>discussing the case but that the board decided Rabbi Zimmerman had\n>violated a part of the ethics code, paragraph 2A, which deals with\n>sexual conduct.\n>\n> It is included in the section of the code on \"personal\n>responsibility,\" which covers such matters as family life, personal\n>honesty and finances. It calls on rabbis \"to be scrupulous in\n>avoiding even the appearance of sexual misconduct, whether by\n>taking advantage of our position with those weaker than ourselves\n>or dependent on us or succumbing to the temptations of willing\n>adults.\"\n>\n> Hebrew Union, which trains men and women as rabbis and cantors and\n>in other graduate and professional fields, has 1,500 students on\n>campuses in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York and Jerusalem. Before\n>becoming president, Rabbi Zimmerman, 58, was senior rabbi of Temple\n>Emanu-El in Dallas from 1985 to 1995, and senior rabbi at Central\n>Synagogue in New York, from 1972 to 1985. He is married and has\n>four children. From 1993 to 1995, he was also the conference's\n>president.\n>\n> Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was first reported yesterday in The\n>Cincinnati Enquirer and The Dallas Morning News.\n>\n> Efforts to reach him through the college and its officials were\n>unsuccessful. The college said it appointed its provost, Norman\n>Cohen, as acting president and would search for a permanent\n>replacement.\n>\n> Rabbi Menitoff said the conference followed \"the same process that\n>we'd follow with any rabbi in the conference in similar\n>circumstances.\" He said complaints against a rabbi are referred to\n>and investigated by the ethics committee. Depending on that\n>committee's findings, the conference may dismiss the complaint,\n>privately reprimand or publicly censure a rabbi or suspendn or\n>expel a rabbi.\n>\n> Rabbi Menitoff said the decision to suspend Rabbi Zimmerman was\n>\"very difficult and painful for everyone involved.\"\n>\n> Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew\n>Congregations, the Reform movement's synagogue organization, said\n>Rabbi Zimmerman did not contest the findings or the judgment\n>against him but responded to the decision \"with great dignity.\"\n>\n> Rabbi Yoffie said that during his tenure as president, Rabbi\n>Zimmerman added younger scholars to the faculty and expanded the\n>college's Los Angeles branch so much that it will begin ordaining\n>rabbis in 2002.\n>\n> Another member of the conference, Rabbi A. James Rudin, emeritus\n>director of interreligious affairs at the American Jewish\n>Committee, said Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was \"a real loss\" and\n>\"a shock to the movement.\"\n>\n> Hebrew Union's chairman, Burton Lehman, praised Rabbi Zimmerman as\n>\"a great, great leader.\" Mr. Lehman said that Rabbi Zimmerman's\n>resignation would \"have an impact\" but that the college was strong.\n>\n> \"Transitionally, we'll be fine,\" Mr. Lehman said. \"We have a\n>strong faculty that will carry this institution through this\n>tribulation.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>The New York Times on the Web\n>http://www.nytimes.com\n>\n>/-----------------------------------------------------------------\\\n>\n>\n>Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the\n>most authoritative news coverage on the Web,\n>updated throughout the day.\n>\n>Become a member today!
